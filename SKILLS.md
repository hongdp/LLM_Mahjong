# Project Skills & Knowledge Base: GCP RLHF

> **🤖 AI Agent Directive**: Whenever you start a new session or work on this repository, you MUST read this file first. As the project evolves, if you encounter new bugs, hardware limitations, or make architectural decisions, you are required to **continuously update and append** to this skill file so that the project's context is never lost.

## 1. Architectural Philosophy
*   **Three-Phase Deployment Strategy**:
    *   `Phase 0 (Local)`: Prototyping and logic debugging on local limited hardware.
    *   `Phase 1 (GCP Compute Engine)`: High-freedom agile development on an on-demand GPU VM (Start -> Sync -> Train -> Auto-Shutdown).
    *   `Phase 2 (GCP Vertex AI)`: Serverless, containerized Custom Training Jobs for large-scale unattended runs.
*   **Modular Reward System**: All environment reward models MUST be modularized. We use a registry pattern (`src/rewards/registry.py`) and a base class (`BaseRewardModel`). Never hardcode reward logic into the main training loop.

## 2. Hardware Constraints & Workarounds (Local RTX 4080 16GB)
*   **Constraint**: Standard FP16 RLHF training for modern models (e.g., 4B+ parameters like Gemma 4) will instantly cause Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors on a 16GB VRAM GPU due to the need for multiple model copies (Active, Reference, Reward) and optimizer states.
*   **Solution implemented**:
    *   **QLoRA (4-bit)**: Must load models using `bitsandbytes` in 4-bit `nf4` precision.
    *   **TRL Native PEFT**: Rely on `trl`'s native handling of `peft_config`. By doing this, `trl` will use the base model weights with adapters turned off for the reference model pass, saving massive amounts of VRAM (eliminating the need to load a separate reference model).
    *   **Tiny Batch Sizes**: Keep `batch_size` and `mini_batch_size` down to 1 or 2 for Phase 0 testing.

## 3. Security & Git Hygiene
*   **NEVER** commit GCP service account keys (`*key.json`, `*credentials.json`), local environment variables (`.env`), or massive model checkpoints (`*.safetensors`, `*.pt`) to Git. The `.gitignore` has been specifically tailored to prevent this.
*   **COMMIT CONFIRMATION RULE**: When the project reaches a certain milestone and passes necessary tests, the AI MUST explicitly ask the USER if they want to create a Git commit. **The AI MUST NOT run `git commit` or any auto-commit scripts without first receiving explicit confirmation from the USER.**

## 4. Current Setup Status (May 2026)
- **Framework Replacement**: Abandoned `trl`'s `PPOTrainer`/`GRPOTrainer` due to their inability to handle interactive multi-turn POMDPs. Implemented a custom decoupled architecture (`ReplayBuffer` -> Custom Advantage Trainer).
- **Environment Decoupling**: All Mahjong physics and LangGraph orchestration logic moved to `src/tasks/mahjong`.
- **Secrets Management**: Implemented `python-dotenv` for securely loading `HF_TOKEN` from `.env`.
- **Local Testing Constraint**: The `peft` library upcasts embeddings to fp32. For Gemma models with 256k vocabs, this allocates >10GB VRAM instantly, causing OOM on 16GB GPUs even for 2B models. Use `Qwen2.5-0.5B` for local Phase 0 verifications.

- **RL Environment Stability**: For small LLMs, strict output formatting is achieved by combining Chain-of-Thought (`<think>`) prompts with Regex action parsing. Hallucinations (e.g. discarding unowned tiles) are managed via Action Masking (Forced legal rollout) to prevent infinite loops while preserving the negative gradient.

### Engine v2 & Training Lessons (Aug 2026)
- **Ukeire-greedy discard policy is a trap**: ranking discards by raw ukeire type-count REGRESSES hands — looser (higher-shanten) hands accept more tile types, so the metric favours breaking joints. Always rank by (post-discard shanten, then ukeire): `TileEfficiency.evaluate_discards_ranked`. This bug silently shaped both the original SFT teacher and the step reward model.
- **Greedy decoding kills RL**: `model.generate()` defaults to `do_sample=False`; policy-gradient RL then explores nothing and can only reinforce the SFT prior. Rollout generation must sample (we use temperature 0.9, top_p 0.95).
- **LangGraph recursion_limit defaults to 25** — a real full-length mahjong round needs hundreds of node transitions; pass `config={"recursion_limit": 1000}` to `graph.invoke`.
- **Qwen3.5 on 16GB (RTX 4080)**: Qwen3.5-2B trains fine with QLoRA but (a) peft has no default LoRA target-module mapping for `qwen3_5` — pass `target_modules=[q/k/v/o/gate/up/down_proj]` explicitly; (b) the 248k vocab doubles CE logits memory — max batch_size 2 at ~900-token sequences (batch 4 OOMs). Generation is fast (~1.5s/128tok on transformers 5.8).
- **SFT CoT must be faithful**: template "think" phrases get parroted verbatim by small models (observed May 2026). Derive the think text from the SAME computation that picks the action (shanten counts, ukeire comparisons, wait tiles, yaku from the scorer).

### RLHF Experiment Execution
- **Fresh Environments:** Every time a new training run is triggered, a new timestamped experiment directory must be created (e.g. `exp_name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`) to avoid overwriting previous data. The only exception is when explicitly resuming a run (using the `--resume` flag).
- **Experiment Records (Aug 2026):** All experiments MUST follow the shared `ml-experiment-tracking` skill (`~/Workspace/SKILLS/ml-experiment-tracking/SKILL.md`, linked into `~/.claude/skills/`): write `EXPERIMENT.md` (purpose / method / success criteria) BEFORE launching, append progress during the run, record results / conclusion / artifact manifest after, and keep `experiments/INDEX.md` up to date. The May 2026 baseline run left no record of its intent or outcome — that must not happen again.

### Status Snapshot (Aug 2026)
- **Project idle since ~May 21, 2026.** Uncommitted work at that point: `--peft_model_path` support in `trainer.py` (load a pre-trained SFT LoRA adapter and skip warm-up) + loosened action regex, and the matching `baseline.json` changes.
- **Blocking issue found in last run** (`experiments/baseline_local_run_20260517_034738`): during RL rollout, ~122/134 model outputs contained NO `<action>` tag (model emitted bare tile lists like `3s 4s 6s 9s ...`), all falling back to `<action type="skip" />`. Root-cause hypothesis: `baseline.json` points `peft_model_path` at the **config_test_run** adapter, which only had **1 SFT epoch on 500 samples** — insufficient format grounding. The `full_run_20260517_035217` checkpoint had 3 SFT epochs (final loss 0.0725) and is the better candidate.
- **Metric caveat**: the loosened `_action_re` in `trainer.py` now matches ANY `type="..."` value, so hallucinated types (`reveal`, `hold`, `add_to_pool` were observed) count as "format compliant" and earn +5.0 in phase-1 reward. Needs a whitelist of legal action types.
- **Repo layout**: `experiments/` and `.antigravitycli/` added to `.gitignore` (Aug 2026). Top-level `checkpoints/` (2.4G) and `logs/` are legacy pre-experiment-system outputs — superseded by per-experiment dirs; safe to archive/delete manually. `src/data_loader.py` and `src/models/` are unused skeleton stubs from the original template.
- **Engine audit (Aug 2026)**: full issue list with severity ranking lives in `docs/engine_known_issues.md`. **Do NOT launch a long RL run until the P0 items there are fixed** — as of the audit, reward exploits (unconditional riichi bonus, meld instant rewards on hands that can never win, model-supplied ron tile) and the missing loser-reward plumbing mean RL would optimize score hacks, not mahjong. Keep that file's checkboxes updated as fixes land.

### GCP Phase 1 Infra Facts & Lessons (Aug 2026)
- **Project**: `workstation-185016` (billing enabled). Results bucket: `gs://llm-mahjong-experiments` (us-central1). VM: `mahjong-a100` (a2-highgpu-1g, 1×A100 40GB) in **us-central1-b** — zone `-a` was A100-STOCKOUT on 2026-08-01; the error message lists which zones still have capacity.
- **Quotas (checked 2026-08-01)**: A100-40GB=1 (A2_CPUS=12, exactly one a2-highgpu-1g), L4=8, T4=4, A100-80GB=0, H100 metric absent (must request), **PREEMPTIBLE_CPUS=0 in every region → Spot VMs unusable until a quota bump**. TPU v5e quota exists but bitsandbytes has no XLA backend and interactive rollouts thrash XLA recompilation — not worth the port for this workload.
- **GPU selection for this pipeline**: wall-clock is dominated by RL rollout (batch-1 autoregressive decode), which is **memory-bandwidth-bound, not compute- or VRAM-bound**. Rank GPUs by bandwidth: L4 300GB/s < RTX 4080 717GB/s < A100 1.6TB/s. An L4 is *slower than the local 4080* and saves nothing ($43 vs $48 per full run); A100 40GB on-demand (~$3.67/h, ~13h) is the sweet spot.
- **Default VM service-account scope is `devstorage.read_only`** — GCS uploads fail silently late. Create VMs with `--scopes=storage-rw,...` (baked into `scripts/phase1_ce/start_vm.sh`).
- **DLVM `common-cu129-*` images ship NO conda** (despite older docs) — bootstrap a plain python3.10 venv; pinned deps in `scripts/phase1_ce/requirements_pinned.txt` (mirrors the local rlhf_mahjong env; torch cu130 wheels need the driver-580 image family).
- **`trainer.py --resume` only reuses the directory name** — no optimizer/epoch state restore, and no checkpoint exists until SFT fully completes. Until real mid-run resume lands, preemptible/Spot runs would corrupt the pre-registered epoch-count criteria; run on-demand.
- **Run hygiene**: `run_training.sh` traps EXIT → uploads the whole experiment dir + nohup log to GCS, then `shutdown -h now`, so the VM never idles on the meter even on crash.
